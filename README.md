# ClipShare Webapp

A modern video-sharing platform built with **Angular** and **Tailwind CSS**, created as a capstone project that brings together UI design, application logic, media handling, and cloud deployment.

## About Me

My name is **Tanner Hart**, and I'm a developer with a strong interest in building digital products that are simple, efficient, and practical. I enjoy working across both design and engineering layers, and I gravitate toward projects that help me refine what I know while pushing me to learn new concepts.

Over the past few years, I've worked on a wide range of applications—from marketing sites and UI components to full-stack software—while also running and supporting multiple small businesses. These experiences taught me how to think critically about usability, performance, and scalability. Clipshare became a perfect opportunity to merge these skills into a single, full-featured application.

I have a background in computer science and web development, with experience in frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue**, as well as backend technologies like **Node.js** and **Firebase**. I'm passionate about creating seamless user experiences and writing clean, maintainable code. I’ve worked as part of several development teams and am currently a developer at **AMain Hobbies**.

## What is Clipshare?

Clipshare is a lightweight, modern video-sharing platform built as my capstone project. It allows users to:

* Upload and manage videos
* Browse content with a clean, responsive UI
* View video details and metadata
* Interact with a streamlined interface

Clipshare mimics the essential experience of large video platforms while remaining simple and focused.

### Features

* Fast, responsive UI built with **Angular + Tailwind CSS**
* Clean, modern layout designed for clarity
* Smooth video handling powered by **Firebase Storage**
* Dynamic routing and transitions for a native feel
* Minimal friction when navigating or watching content

---

## Why I Built This

I wanted a project that challenged me across the full web development stack—UI design, client-side logic, data persistence, and deployment. Video platforms bring unique challenges: storage, responsiveness, playback behavior, and performance across devices.

Building Clipshare helped me deepen my experience with:

* Learning Angular in more depth
* Rapid UI development using Tailwind
* Implementing a simple but rewarding app with clip-sharing features

---

## Tools & Technologies

Clipshare was built using a combination of modern web technologies:

### Core Stack

* **Angular** – Component-driven UI architecture
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
* **Firebase Storage** – Media storage and delivery
* **Firebase Auth** – User authentication
* **GitHub** – Version control and workflow
* **Vercel** – Deployment, previews, and hosting

Additional tools include various UI libraries, development utilities, and workflow enhancers.

## Deployment & Hosting

Clipshare is deployed using **Vercel**, which provides fast, free hosting for personal and passion projects.

### Frontend Deployment

* Fully client-side Angular application
* Built with Angular's production build pipeline
* Served through Vercel's global CDN for speed and caching
* Client-side routing configured to resolve all routes to `index.html`

### Media Storage & Streaming

* Videos and metadata stored in **Firebase Storage**
* Handles large file uploads, resumable sessions, and streaming URLs
* Distributed through Firebase’s global CDN
* Auth handled through Firebase Authentication

### CI/CD Workflow

* Managed through **GitHub**
* Every push triggers an automatic Vercel preview or production deployment
* Safe testing through branch previews
* Automatic rebuilds and instant rollbacks

---

## What I Learned

Building Clipshare reinforced key concepts across software development and deployment:

* Component-driven architecture with Angular
* UI development with Tailwind CSS
* Balancing simplicity with interactive functionality
* Handling media files with cloud storage
* Understanding caching, compression, and storage limits
* Basic database rules and security
* Deploying scalable static applications with Vercel’s CI/CD pipeline

This project strengthened my front-end engineering skills and broadened my understanding of modern hosting and cloud tooling.
