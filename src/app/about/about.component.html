      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-white-700">
        My name is Tanner Hart, and I’m a developer with a strong interest in building digital products that are simple,
        efficient, and practical. I enjoy working across both design and engineering layers, and I gravitate toward projects
        that let me refine my existing knowledge while also learning new concepts.
      
        Over the past few years I’ve worked on a wide range of applications—everything from marketing sites and UI components
        to full stack software—while also running and supporting multiple small businesses. These experiences taught me how to
        think critically about usability, performance, and scalability in real-world environments. Clipshare became a perfect
        opportunity for me to merge those practical and technical skills into a single, full-featured application.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-700">
        I have a background in computer science and web development, with experience in frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue,
        as well as backend technologies like Node.js and Firebase. I’m passionate about creating seamless user experiences and writing
        clean, maintainable code. I have worked as a part of a few development teams, and am currently working at AMain Hobbies as apart
        of their development team.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">What is Clipshare?</h2>
    <p class="text-white-700">
      Clipshare is a lightweight, modern video-sharing platform built as my capstone project. It allows users to upload
      videos, browse content, view details, and interact with a streamlined, responsive interface. I designed Clipshare to
      mimic the essential experience of larger video platforms but with a simpler, more focused approach to usability.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Why I Built This</h2>
    <p class="text-white-700">
      I chose this project because I wanted something that challenged me across the full web development stack—UI design,
      application logic, data persistence, media handling, and deployment. Video-based projects bring unique challenges:
      storage, performance, responsive design, playback behavior, and consistent UX across device sizes.

    <p>Building Clipshare allowed me to deepen my experience with: </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-white-700 space-y-2">
      <li>To learn more about Angular compared to the frameworks I use more often.</li>
      <li>I prefer using tailwind over writing custom CSS for rapid UI development.</li>
      <li>I wanted a simple program to learn concepts that also had rewarding features like the ability to share clips with friends.</li>

  <!-- Deployment & Hosting Section -->
  <section id="deployment" class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Deployment & Hosting</h2>
    <div class="text-white-700 space-y-4">
      <p>This project is deployed using Vercel as they allow free unlimited hosting for passion projects, perfect for
        presenting side projects like this.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-4">Frontend (Client) Deployment</h3>
      <p>
        Clipshare is built as a near fully client side Angular application styled with Tailwind CSS.
        The production build is generated using Angular’s build pipeline, producing a highly efficient static
        bundle.
        Vercel serves this bundle through its global network, ensuring fast load times, automatic caching, and
        instant rollback capabilities.
        Client side routing is configured to rewrite all non file paths to <code>index.html</code>, allowing deep links
        and browser refreshes to work correctly.
      </p>
  
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-4">Media Storage & Streaming</h3>
      <p>
        All video uploads and related metadata are stored in Firebase.
        Firebase Storage is responsible for handling large media assets, managing upload sessions, delivering
        optimized streaming URLs for playback, as well as user authentication.
        Videos are distributed through Firebase’s global CDN, ensuring smooth and consistent performance across devices.
        This approach keeps backend complexity low while providing a reliable and scalable media layer for the
        application. A bonus is its also free.
      </p>
  
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-4">CI/CD & Workflow</h3>
      <p>
        The project is managed through GitHub, and every push triggers an automated deployment pipeline in Vercel.
        Feature branches generate preview deployments that allow testing changes in an environment before
        merging.
        When updates are merged into the main branch, Vercel automatically builds and publishes a fresh production
        version.
        This workflow enabled rapid iteration, safe testing, and continuous delivery throughout development.
